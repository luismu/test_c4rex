## TEST C4REX

# Config:

# Routes:

 1) /guests --> How many guests each DJ invited.
 2) /top --> A leader board of the most liked DJ in the world. 
 3) /location --> How many people are being picked up from each location.

# Task 1

The class `MongoBooksRepository` violates some programming paradigms, we would like to you to refactor this!

Goals

1) Keep the original functionality.
2) Increase the inner code quality.
3) Increase test coverage with unit tests.

Rules

- The interface of the MongoBooksRepository can't be changed but (of course) it's content can change and it can be split into new classes.
- The `MongoDbClient/MongoDbConnection` should be mocked, they can not be changed.
- Use a testing framework like PHPunit


# Task 2

Afrojack, Tiesto and Hardwell are planning to go on a world tour in their private jet. In order for all their friends to be aboard they need a system to find out where to find them.
 
The `guests.json` file includes their guests, who invited them and their pickup locations. 
 
Build a system that lets you query the guests of each DJ; We need to know: 

    • How many guests each DJ invited
    • A leader board of the most liked DJ in the world. 
    • How many people are being picked up from each location
 
You do not need to build a graphical UI or use a database, but you should architect the code to potentially support such an addition in the future. You should build an OOP system which makes use of Models and Controllers. Please do this in Typescript, NodeJS or PHP. 


## DONE

When finished please send me this to my email thank you.
